# Fresh Start - Complete Setup Guide

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Create New GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name**: `EduLingo` (or any name you prefer)
3. **Description**: "English Course Platform - Learning Management System"
4. **Visibility**: 
   - ✅ **Public** (recommended for free Vercel)
   - OR Private (if you have Vercel Pro)
5. **DO NOT** check:
   - ❌ "Add a README file"
   - ❌ "Add .gitignore"
   - ❌ "Choose a license"
6. **Click "Create repository"**

### Step 2: Connect Local Code to New GitHub Repo

After creating the repo, GitHub will show you commands. We'll run them here.

**Copy the repository URL from GitHub** (it will look like):
- HTTPS: `https://github.com/IBR0521/EduLingo.git`
- OR SSH: `git@github.com:IBR0521/EduLingo.git`

### Step 3: Push Code to GitHub

Once you have the new repo URL, we'll:
1. Add the new remote
2. Stage all files
3. Commit everything
4. Push to GitHub

### Step 4: Deploy to Vercel

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/new
2. Import your new GitHub repository
3. Configure settings
4. Add environment variables
5. Deploy!
